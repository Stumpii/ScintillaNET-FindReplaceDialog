# ScintillaNET-FindReplaceDialog
A ScintillaNET v3 Find &amp; Replace Dialog + Goto Dialog + Incremental Search

# ScintillaNET

[ScintillaNET v3](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET) is a Windows Forms control, wrapper, and bindings for the versatile [Scintilla](http://www.scintilla.org/) source code editing component. It does not contain a Find & Replace dialog often seen in Scintilla based editors (Notepad++, SciTE, etc.).

ScintillaNET v2.5 contained Find & Replace, Goto and Incremental Search dialogs which were not included in the v3 branch. The project ports those v2.5 features into a library that will function with v3 ScintillaNET.

## Documentation

For documentation, refer to the project [Wiki](https://github.com/Stumpii/ScintillaNET-FindReplaceDialog/wiki) which has examples of how to integrate this library with ScintillaNET.

## Background

I have been using ScintillaNet v2.5 for a number of years. The reasons are the conversion to v3 are well [documented](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET#background), however some features were sorely missed. I started to work these features in a personal clone of ScintillaNET v3, copying chunks of v2.5 code I needed and fixing/converting along the way. All credit goes to [Jacob Slusser](https://github.com/jacobslusser) for writing and maintaining ScintillaNET v2.5 and v3.
